# Project 3 - Procedures
In this third project should you be working with what have been discussed regarding aync programming and code first databases.

You should work in the group during the second half of the lecture.

Your group going to present (a mini-presentation) the key points of you solution. And the rest of the class will give a points for the solution.

Work with mob programming, one driver, 15 min per driver (for your own sake, everybody learns of both being the driver but also from being a co-driver).

**Deadline** is 2021-03-29 at 09:00, with presentation same day (29th of march).

## Team

The team consist of 4 to 5 persons (two buddy groups), see PingPong.

## Code review/pull request

At the end of the project will we do at least one [pull request](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests), each should be reviewed by two other teams.

Make sure to use code reviews. The best is to collect code reviews by functionality. So when you have some functionality ready send it for code review to the other two teams.

When your team receives a code review make sure to perform is as soon as possible, but you should not throw everything you are working on just to do the review.

## Mini-presentation of the project

On Monday 29th of march 9:30, will each group do a mini presentation. You should long before the presentation have made decision in the group who is going to do the talking.

Be sharp you only have **8 min**.

The rest of class will give a vote, scale is 1-5, see below.

### When voting

Remember to write the group you are voting on and your own group on the voting paper. Otherwise is the vote considered invalid.

Look for the following in the presentation:

- Code
- Tests
- Patterns
- Readiness
- Presentation

### Voting

When voting send a PM to the **teacher** with you vote, on the following format `[YOUR TEAM NUMBER];[NUMBER OF TEAM GETTING VOTE];[VOTE]`

Example:

You are part of team 9 and are about to vote for team 10, you which to give the vote 3. In that case you send the following PM: `9;10;3`

## Points

- Presentation, team-point
- A driver check-in, personal-point
- A vote, team-point
- Code reviews, team-point for creating the review and for performing the review.
